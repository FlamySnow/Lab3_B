#Printed Circuit Board
>In this repository you can find a library for work with PCB, also you can try to do it using application program, sources of which is *main.cpp* file.

##Description of class

###Structure "Contact"

This class includes structure of contact, which is described with following data:
* *contactType **type*** - it is type of contact, can be *in* or *out*, initially *notStated*;
* *int **x*** - the first coordinate of a contact, can be any integer number, initially is zero;
* *int **y*** - the second coordinate, same as *x*;
* *unsigned short **numberOfContact*** - number of connected contact with this contact, when there are no such contact is **-1** (initially);

Contacts can be connected between itself, but it is possible, only if these contacts aren't connected with another contacts and these contacts are of different types (*in* and *out*);

###State of class

The class is described the following way:
* *unsigned short **maxNumber*** - max possible number of contacts, can be changed only manually.
* *Contact **contacts[maxNumber]*** - it is an array of contacts;
* *unsigned short **currentNumber*** - current number of contacts, initially is zero.

###Private Methods

For serviceable work of all public methods of the class there are these private methods:
1. *bool **isCorrectCoordinates** (int x, int y)* - returns true if there are not a contact with such coordinates, false in other situations;
2. *contactType **isCorrectType** (int t)* - checks if the *t* is **1** or **0** and returns a corresponding *contactType*, else calls exception;
3. *bool **isCorrectNumber** (short n)* - returns true if there is a contact with number *n*;
4. *bool **isCorrectConnection** (short c1, short c2)* - checks conditions for connection of two contacts.

###Public Methods

1. *operator **>>*** - you can use this operator for input a contact, it has checks for correct type;
2. *operator **<<*** - this operator can be used to print information as about PCB as about a Contact;
3. *operator **+=*** - this operator adds to PCB a specified contact;
4. ***establishConnect** (short c1, short c2)* - this method connects contacts with numbers *c1* and *c2* if it satisfies needed conditions;
5. *operator --* deletes last added contact;
6. *operator [short c]* allows you get information about contact with specified number;
7. *operator (short c1, short c2)* returns a length of track between two connected contacts;
8. ***groupOfContacts** (unsigned short)* returns a group of contacts with specified type;
9. *getCurrentNumber* just returns current number of contacts;
10. *getMaxNumber* returns max number of contacts.
